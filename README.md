# Breast-Cancer-Classification

* Breast cancer is now the most common cancer in Indian women, having recently overtaken cervical cancer in this respect.
For every 2 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, one woman dies of it in India.

* For women diagnosed during 2010-14, five-year survival for breast cancer is now 89.5% in Australia and 90.2% in the USA, but international differences remain very wide, with levels as low as 66.1% in India.

**Deep learning**,  a state-of-the-art type of artificial intelligence that can be used by computers to detect and classify objects in images, could improve detection of breast cancer lesions in mammograms and help in the classification of breast cancer.
